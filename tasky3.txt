/** Aspx file **/

Seperate javscript
Seperate css
Bundle? 
Should the JS and Css even be referenced in this file?
GetLanguageString("/applicationform/requiredfield") -> make one method/property?
Visible='<%# Int32.Parse(PropertyService.GetStringProperty(CurrentPage, "NumberOfFileUploads")) > 0 %>'> -> Backend Logic?


/** Aspx.cs **/
Naming convention? btnShowFileUpload_Click - Btn_SubmitForm_Click
Spilt up logic into different services/helpers/logic classes.
Hardcoded data (i.e. ContactPerson)!!! -> move to CurrentPage or xml or db
(string s in addresses) what is s? -> Bad readability of code!

Naming of properties and parameters
string applicationSender = Txt_Email.Text;
BuildMail(applicationSender
protected MailMessage BuildMail(string toAddresses

BuildEmailContent -> dynamically load the controller and get the string from it with html. No need to write html in CB.


Cannot figure it out with multiple upload controls?
